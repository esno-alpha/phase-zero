If you're not my bro, one of his colleagues, or the FBI, it's actually a miracle that you've found your way here. 
I'm actually not sure what you hoped to find... unless it was a recipe for baking some mighty fine banana bread.

Basically this is a repository for me to dump my wonderful attempts at becoming a front end web dev deity, 
and eventually upload my consciousness to twitch.

Don't ask me how. Just believe. And enjoy your banana bread.
