	<p>
	<em>Ingredients:</em>
	<ul>
	<li>3 ripe bananas</li>
	<li>125g butter, melted</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons of bicarb</li>
	<li>½ cup of sugar</li>
	<li>1½ cups of gluten free flour / buckwheat flour</li>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla essence <em>OR</em> 2 teaspoons of cinnamon</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<br>

	<p>
	<em>Directions:</em>
	<ol>
	<li>Set oven to 180ºC</li>
	<li>Line a baking loaf tin with baking paper</li>
	<li>Warm up the butter in a saucepan, allowing it to melt over a low heat</li>
	<li>Beat the two eggs in a large mixing bowl</li>
	<li>Mash the bananas</li>
	<li>Mix in the sugar and melted butter</li>
	<li>Add the bicarb and continue mixing</li>
	<li>Tip in the flour and fold gently so there's no small specks of white</li>
	<li>Pour the bowl into the baking tin, and place in the oven for 1 hour</li>
	<li>After an hour, bring the loaf out of the oven and test with a skewer - if it comes out free of batter, it's ready</li>
	<li>Carefully lift the banana bread out of the tin (still in its baking paper) and place on a cooling rack. Wait for it to cool before cutting</li>
</ol>
